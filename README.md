# Driver Attention Monitoring System

## Overview

Welcome to the Driver Attention Monitoring System repository! This project aims to develop a system that monitors a driver's attention level to enhance road safety. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze the driver's behavior and detect signs of drowsiness or distraction.

## Introduction

Driving requires constant attention, and lapses in concentration can lead to accidents. The Driver Attention Monitoring System employs advanced computer vision algorithms to track the driver's facial features and monitor their alertness. By analyzing factors such as eye movement, head position, and blink rate, the system can identify signs of fatigue or distraction.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of driver attention levels
- Detection of drowsiness and distraction
- Visual and audible alerts to prompt the driver when necessary

## Installation

To install the Driver Attention Monitoring System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. Run the system:
   python main.py
## Usage
Start the system by running the main script.
The system will access the camera feed and begin monitoring the driver's attention.
Receive real-time feedback on the driver's attention level.
